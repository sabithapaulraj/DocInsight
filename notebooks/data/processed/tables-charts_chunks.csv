INTRODUCTION
We have, in the various units so far, discussed some of the skills of written communication.
In this unit, we shall discuss a method of communication, which is slightly different i.e.
communication by means of tables, charts, and graphs. These devices supplement the
information presented through words and help the reader to understand the facts and
figures more easily.
5.2
THE FUNCTION OF TABLES, CHARTS AND
GRAPHS",434
2,0,23,23,"a)
When you decide to use tables, charts and graphs, you should know where you can
incorporate them in your writing. Even when you are searching for information,
identify concepts and data that will lend themselves to representation through tables,
charts, etc. Pay special attention to those ideas or data which will present difficulties
to your reader. It will be a good idea to present some of these difficult ideas through
tables and charts. It is wise to use fresh illustration each time you need one. The use
of ready-made graphs or photographs will not always be so relevant to the point you
are making.",610
3,0,24,0,"b)
Let us now try and understand the function of tables, charts and graphs.

The use of tables, charts and graphs enables you to highlight the main points of
the information contained in the text.

It enables you to present the information more concisely. Writing on a
complicated topic can take up several pages, while the same information can be
presented in less space by a table or a chart.
75",399
4,1,1,3,"Writing Skills

These devices enable you to make vivid comparisons and show the relations
between facts.

They help to summarise data and ideas, and simplify and arrange complicated
details, so that the reader can easily follow them.
5.3
TABLES",246
5,1,4,4,"A table is a collection of figures, facts or other information arranged in columns and rows.
The readers locate the information they need by reading across a row, and up or down a
column. So when you design tables your major concern is to provide adequate spacing
between columns and rows so that your readers can find the information easily. You will
find that tables are useful for a number of things.",403
6,1,5,8,"
They can show a number of specific data is a brief space. If such data were presented
in the text itself, the reader would have to go through a succession of figures/
sentences occurring in the text.

Tables eliminate tedious repetition of words, phrases, and sentence patterns that can
be put at the tops of columns, or at the side of rows in the table.
Because a table displays its information in rows and columns, it can be useful for
juxtaposing data in two or more dimensions for easy comparison and contrast. Example 1,
below, tells you what is meant by a column and a row.
Example 1",592
7,1,9,22,"Main Types of Viral Hepatitis
Viral hepatitis type B
(Serum hepatitis)
Viral hepatitis type A
(infections hepatitis)
These viruses are present in
the blood and other body
fluids of infected people,
many of whom appear to be
in normal health. Infection is
spread sexually or by sharing
hypodermic needles. In the
past it was spread by use of
contaminated blood and blood
products.",379
8,1,16,12,"Virus is present in the faeces
of infected people and
transmitted to others by faecal
contamination of water and
food (e.g. through infected
people handling food). Faeces
are infective from two to three
weeks before until eight days
after the onset of jaundice.
Local epidemics can occur.
Transmission of infections
In some parts of Africa and
Asia upto 20% of the
population are carriers of one
or both viruses, often without
symptoms.
Worldwide. In some parts of
the world, where hygiene is
poor, almost everyone has
been exposed to this type of
hepatitis.
Incidence
Groups at particular risks",595
9,1,24,26,"Male homosexuals, people
with multiple sexual partners,
intravenous drug abusers,
health care personnel or
children born to carrier
mothers.
Travellers to areas where
hygiene standards are poor and
prevalence of the virus is high
(i.e. parts of Asia, Africa, or
South America).
A few weeks to several
months after infection.
Incubation period
There to six weeks after virus
has entered the body.
Typical acute hepatitis often
more severe than with type A
virus. Progression to chronic
hepatitis and other liver
disease may occur.
Sometimes, no illness.",552
10,1,20,0,"In many cases there is no
illness. Otherwise, typical
acute hepatitis (flu-like illness
with jaundice), usually mild
and never progressing to
chronic hepatitis.

A vaccine is available against
hepatitis B for high risk
groups.
Recommended for frequent
travellers to Africa and Asia.
Two doses of vaccine, 2-4
weeks apart. Then a booster
six to 12 months later, gives
around ten years protection.

12,2,3,4,"As is made amply clear by the example given above, tables allow easy comparisons which
might be difficult to understand if they appeared in the form of paragraphs.
Tables can be divided into two broad types: dependent tables and independent tables. A
dependent table is an integral part of the text. It needs no title or caption because it is given
in continuation of the text. Such a table contain a small amount of information, probably a
maximum of three columns and rows, and a dozen or so numbers.",502
13,2,5,7,"An independent table may be placed physically within the text but is to be clearly
distinguished from it. Example 2 proves the point.

14,2,8,8,"In 1977, a sample survey conducted by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases
(NICD), estimated the number of Kala-azar cases to be 70,000 with 4,500 estimated deaths.
However, 16,589 cases and 229 deaths were detected through searches while during 1978 and
1979, 41, 953 and 25, 172 cases respectively were detected. In the later years, the figures relate
to only those which came to Health Centres/hospitals for treatment, hence the figures are low.

16,2,23,0,"In an independent table, you are inviting your readers to look at the tabular information
separately while reading the text. Generally, such tables can present a large amount of
information. They require the reader to stop and reflect on the details about the facts and
their arrangement. Such a table usually has a table number and a caption. The caption
should be carefully written so that you focus the reader's attention on the significant facts
presented in the table. Of course, a written summary of the facts presented in the table
should also be given, highlighting the important facts.
77",597
17,3,1,3,"Writing Skills
In some cases a summary of the table is given in the text, and the full table is placed in the
appendix.
It will be useful to keep certain points in mind when you prepare tables of your own.

If you are using several independent tables, you should assign each table a table
number. (Look at example 2 again). In the text itself, each table should be referred to by
the table number rather than by a phrase such as ‘the table above….’ If your text has
more than five tables, they should be listed in a separate page after ‘Table of
Contents,’ labeled as ‘List of Tables’.",586
18,3,4,6,"
The title of the table can be placed either above or below the table. It should describe
in very precise language the contents of the table.

Each column should have a heading. This heading should be brief and accurate. Units
of measurement, if required, are enclosed in brackets beneath the heading. You may
use standard abbreviations, if you like.

In the left-hand vertical column of the table, we list the items about which information
is given in the table.",466
19,3,7,7,"
The main body of the table comprises the data below each heading in the column. It is
very essential to present the information in the body as clearly as possible. The
presentation of information is dependent to a large extent on the way lines are drawn
in independent tables. You can have a choice of an open design, a semi-closed design
or a closed design. An open design is one which has no vertical or horizontal lines in
it. A semi-closed design has some vertical and/or some horizontal lines. A closed
design has both vertical and horizontal lines separating virtually all the items.",591

closed design.

CHARTS AND GRAPHS",158
25,4,13,14,"The term chart is used to refer to i) a detailed map of a sea area, and ii) information
presented in the form of a picture or a graph to make it easily understood. We shall use it
here in the latter sense. This presentation through diagrams and graphs can take various
forms, including what is known as a flow diagram or a flowchart. These charts simplify the
detailed information that is presented and help in its interpretation. Trends, movements,
and distributions can be presented in a more comprehensive manner in graphs than in
tables.
5.4.1 Line Graphs",559
26,4,15,31,"A graph is usually a straight or curved line which is drawn between a vertical (that is, an
upright) line and a horizontal (that is, a level line) across the page, to connect a series of
points representing the varying values of two related things. It, thus, primarily shows the
relationship between two sets of figures or two variables. The fixed lines — horizontal and
vertical — used as reference points are known as axis, each representing one set of figures
or one variable. (See Example 3)

Below shows the use of a number of lines in the same graph. In preparing such graphs each
line has to be given a label. You can emphasize the difference between two lines by shading
the space that separate them. In order to differentiate between the different lines, you can use
different colours, or a dotted line, a broken line, a semi-broken line, a thick line, a thin line, etc.

graph? There can be no single correct answer. For instance, the graph in Example 5 below
has five lines in it, and yet it is not too cluttered. Why? Because the principal objective of
presenting that graph is to show that the lines all move in a parallel direction. However, you
will realize that if those lines had begun to move across one another, the load of
information would be too great for a reader to absorb.

5.4.3 Flow-charts
Not all charts represent quantitative information. For example, you may wish to illustrate
the stages of a process, point out locations, give directions, or show relationships. You can
do this by using flow charts, diagrams, and maps.",542
45,8,8,8,"A flow-chart (or flow diagram) is a drawing in which particular shapes and connecting lines
are used to show how each particular action in a system is connected with the others.",177
46,8,9,9,"Flow-charts are an excellent way of illustrating the stages or the steps of a process, or the
pathways along which information of components is to travel during specific operations.
Flow-charts can show a series of steps that occur in a sequence, or they can show a
number of steps or processes that occur simultaneously. They are drawn using a set of
conventional symbols that represent various operations. The symbols are connected by
arrows to indicate the order in which the activities will occur. We give below a small
selection of symbols which will be sufficient to demonstrate their use in flow-charts.",610
47,8,10,0,"A terminal symbol. It is a symbol used to denote the beginning and end of a flow-chart.
Within the symbol you write START, STOP, END.

An input symbol. It is used to denote the input that is used to trigger off a decision or a

A process symbol. It is used to define the execution of an operation or event. The meaning
of the operation or event can be given within the symbol.
A decision symbol. It is used to ask a specific question, the answer to which should be yes
or no.",363
49,9,4,6,"Using flow-charts is particularly useful if you wish to simplify your descriptions and
provide an easy-to-use visual reference for your readers. For example, a well designed flow-
chart will help you guide your readers through complex descriptions because they present
the entire process at once, and thus serve as a guideline to indicate where you are going
and how you are getting there. Another important use of flow-charts is that they prevent
readers from visualizing complex processes on their own, and thus making mistakes.

The following conclusions may be drawn from the curves:
a)
In humans the absolute growth curve shows four distinct phases of increased
growth.
b)
The relative growth is greatest during embryological development.
c)
Rate of growth is greatest during infancy and adolescence.
d)
Maximum growth in terms of a particular parameter, such as height, is greatest in
the adult.",467

Carbon dioxide levels (and those of other green house gases, notably carbon monoxide,
methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are rising at an alarming rate unprecedented in
the recent earth history and their increased presence will logically favour an increasingly
warmer surface environment.",329
62,13,3,4,"While in the 1990s, carbon dioxide raised the Earth's surface temperature by 0.08oC, by the
2020s, the temperature would rise up to 0.12oC. Similarly the increased presence of CFCs
has undisputed effects on the ozone layer and the surface temperature would rise to 0.20oC.

63,13,5,5,"The industrial waste and domestic sewage is pretreated together. The first step is the
mechanical screening of solids and its separation into solid waste and effluents. The solids
are further separated for primary and secondary sludge. The effluents or soluble fraction is
then aerated for aerobic digestion by microbes, which is once again screened for solids.
This effluent or soluble fraction is once again filtered and separated for nitrates and
phosphates so that the clear water could be discharged.",505
64,13,6,0,"The secondary sludge, which is procured after the first mechanical screening, is
simultaneously processed for anaerobic digestion by microbes, after which the hydrogen,
methane and carbon dioxide are separated. The water content is discharged while the
solids of the digested sludge are used as fertilizers.
Another alternative to the aerobic and anaerobic digestion by microbes is the trickling to
filter activated sludge oxidation ponds and biological fluidized bed.
