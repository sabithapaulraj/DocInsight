INTRODUCTION
We have, in the various units so far, discussed some of the skills of written communication.
In this unit, we shall discuss a method of communication, which is slightly different i.e.
communication by means of tables, charts, and graphs. These devices supplement the
information presented through words and help the reader to understand the facts and
figures more easily.
5.2
THE FUNCTION OF TABLES, CHARTS AND
GRAPHS",434,text
2,0,23.0,23.0,"a)
When you decide to use tables, charts and graphs, you should know where you can
incorporate them in your writing. Even when you are searching for information,
identify concepts and data that will lend themselves to representation through tables,
charts, etc. Pay special attention to those ideas or data which will present difficulties
to your reader. It will be a good idea to present some of these difficult ideas through
tables and charts. It is wise to use fresh illustration each time you need one. The use
of ready-made graphs or photographs will not always be so relevant to the point you
are making.",610,text
3,0,24.0,0.0,"b)
Let us now try and understand the function of tables, charts and graphs.

The use of tables, charts and graphs enables you to highlight the main points of
the information contained in the text.

It enables you to present the information more concisely. Writing on a
complicated topic can take up several pages, while the same information can be
presented in less space by a table or a chart.
75",399,text
4,1,1.0,3.0,"Writing Skills

These devices enable you to make vivid comparisons and show the relations
between facts.

They help to summarise data and ideas, and simplify and arrange complicated
details, so that the reader can easily follow them.
5.3
TABLES",246,text
5,1,4.0,4.0,"A table is a collection of figures, facts or other information arranged in columns and rows.
The readers locate the information they need by reading across a row, and up or down a
column. So when you design tables your major concern is to provide adequate spacing
between columns and rows so that your readers can find the information easily. You will
find that tables are useful for a number of things.",403,text
6,1,5.0,8.0,"
They can show a number of specific data is a brief space. If such data were presented
in the text itself, the reader would have to go through a succession of figures/
sentences occurring in the text.

Tables eliminate tedious repetition of words, phrases, and sentence patterns that can
be put at the tops of columns, or at the side of rows in the table.
Because a table displays its information in rows and columns, it can be useful for
juxtaposing data in two or more dimensions for easy comparison and contrast. Example 1,
below, tells you what is meant by a column and a row.

in normal health. Infection is
spread sexually or by sharing
hypodermic needles. In the
past it was spread by use of
contaminated blood and blood

Local epidemics can occur.
Transmission of infections
In some parts of Africa and
Asia upto 20% of the
population are carriers of one
or both viruses, often without
symptoms.
Worldwide. In some parts of

might be difficult to understand if they appeared in the form of paragraphs.
Tables can be divided into two broad types: dependent tables and independent tables. A
dependent table is an integral part of the text. It needs no title or caption because it is given
in continuation of the text. Such a table contain a small amount of information, probably a
maximum of three columns and rows, and a dozen or so numbers.",502,text

distinguished from it. Example 2 proves the point.

16,2,23.0,0.0,"In an independent table, you are inviting your readers to look at the tabular information
separately while reading the text. Generally, such tables can present a large amount of
information. They require the reader to stop and reflect on the details about the facts and
their arrangement. Such a table usually has a table number and a caption. The caption
should be carefully written so that you focus the reader's attention on the significant facts
presented in the table. Of course, a written summary of the facts presented in the table
should also be given, highlighting the important facts.

In some cases a summary of the table is given in the text, and the full table is placed in the
appendix.
It will be useful to keep certain points in mind when you prepare tables of your own.

If you are using several independent tables, you should assign each table a table
number. (Look at example 2 again). In the text itself, each table should be referred to by
the table number rather than by a phrase such as ‘the table above….’ If your text has
more than five tables, they should be listed in a separate page after ‘Table of
Contents,’ labeled as ‘List of Tables’.",586,text
18,3,4.0,6.0,"
The title of the table can be placed either above or below the table. It should describe
in very precise language the contents of the table.

Each column should have a heading. This heading should be brief and accurate. Units
of measurement, if required, are enclosed in brackets beneath the heading. You may
use standard abbreviations, if you like.

is given in the table.",466,text

The main body of the table comprises the data below each heading in the column. It is
very essential to present the information in the body as clearly as possible. The
presentation of information is dependent to a large extent on the way lines are drawn
in independent tables. You can have a choice of an open design, a semi-closed design
or a closed design. An open design is one which has no vertical or horizontal lines in
it. A semi-closed design has some vertical and/or some horizontal lines. A closed
design has both vertical and horizontal lines separating virtually all the items.",591,text

upright) line and a horizontal (that is, a level line) across the page, to connect a series of

relationship between two sets of figures or two variables. The fixed lines — horizontal and
vertical — used as reference points are known as axis, each representing one set of figures

Below shows the use of a number of lines in the same graph. In preparing such graphs each
line has to be given a label. You can emphasize the difference between two lines by shading
the space that separate them. In order to differentiate between the different lines, you can use
different colours, or a dotted line, a broken line, a semi-broken line, a thick line, a thin line, etc.

provide an easy-to-use visual reference for your readers. For example, a well designed flow-
chart will help you guide your readers through complex descriptions because they present
the entire process at once, and thus serve as a guideline to indicate where you are going
and how you are getting there. Another important use of flow-charts is that they prevent
readers from visualizing complex processes on their own, and thus making mistakes.

units are collectively known, in current terminology, as the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
It is this to which we really refer when talking about the computer. The other two units, the

mechanical screening of solids and its separation into solid waste and effluents. The solids

then aerated for aerobic digestion by microbes, which is once again screened for solids.
This effluent or soluble fraction is once again filtered and separated for nitrates and
